          <p ><a href="https://www.semesteratsea.org/">Semester At Sea</a>is a study abroad program that is currently hosted by Colorado State University. Essentially you hop on a boat for four months and get to travel the world while taking classes. It's not just any boat though, it's a retired German cruise ship and it is beautiful! This boat, the MV World Odyssey, carries over 400 students, 100 faculty and family, and 200 crew members. I took 12 credits (that all transfered to UM) and visited 11 different countries in just 100 days. </p>

          <h3> Blog Post </h3>
          <p> Despite the occassional complaint about living on a small boat with a lot of people, I LOVED ship life. Classes would pause when a whale or dolphin was spotted and everyone would run the window or outside. Even when it became common to see marine life the excitement never left. On some legs of our voyage it was so rare that we would even see another boat. In fact, the longest leg was two weeks from Hawaii to Japan and I swear I didn't see land once. I would wake up early and go on the deck for sunrise; the ocean is so peaceful and calm at that time. I know you're going to ask about sea sicknesses: yes, everyone felt it as some point, some worse than others. Only when the seas were really rough did I have to take motion sicknesses medicine. My favorite part of the day is sunset; everyone, and I mean everyone is out on the decks soaking in each sunset. Sunsets hit different in the middle of the ocean.</p>
